I've been making TikTok effects since [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/) (the software used to make TikTok effects) came out. This is what I've learnt so far:

## 1. Make it a challenge

I've found when creators can play the game and easily make their own challenge e.g. "I bet you can't beat my score!?", their followers are more likely to want to play too!

## 2. Keep it simple (sometimes)

Generally speaking, people making TikTok's don't have the bandwidth nor concentration span for understanding more than a basic mechanic.

So I usually go with simple face-based logic, like this horse staring contest...

Or tapping...

Or drawing...

## 3. Let creators to express themselves

Sounds obvious, I know. Creators wanna make more videos using your effect if you balance a fun game with a space for them to express themselves.

## 4. Luck

Of the (at time of writing) 8,952,605,076 views of TikToks using my effects, the top 10 account for about 8 billion.

I've made over 100 effects on TikTok, so only 10 of them have seen great 'success'!

And sometimes, you spend no time at all making a stupid satisfying video parody effect, and it becomes part of a viral trend:

If that doesn't emphasize the importance of luck, I don't know what does.
