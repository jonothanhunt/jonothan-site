We all know water tastes better when you've been out in the heat, and I have to apply the same logic to Uber's hot chocolate aboard [Uber boats](https://www.thamesclippers.com/) in London.

So far as I can tell, they're not special. Peaking behind the [onboard café bar](https://www.thamesclippers.com/whats-on-board/onboard-cafe-bar), it looks to me like your run-of-the-mill Cadbury stuff.

But as someone who loves a fancy chocolate drink places like [Knoops](https://knoops.com/uk), I am repeatedly surprised.

Uber boats are such a vibe. They do beer too if the surprisingly good hot chocolate is not your mood! 

Oh and tap in and out with contactless/Oyster when you get there, no need to book online.
