Sometimes, when developing an idea, especially a technical one, I use frameworks, like Edward de Bono's [Thinking Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats), the [SCAMPER method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCAMPER) or [First Principles](https://fs.blog/first-principles/).

A few days ago I made [a site](https://think.jonothan.dev) which summarizes the steps involved in some common frameworks. As an experiment I implemented a cheap to run AI model which takes the summary of an idea you type in, and generates questions based on the steps of each framework.

![Screenshot of the site showing the idea I put in and available frameworks. The idea is: A mobile app that helps people overcome social anxiety by gamifying real-world social interactions with achievement badges and progress tracking.](/things-content/thinking-frameworks-and-AI/images/site-screenshot.jpg)

After typing in some ideas I've been working on, I was surprised at the quality of questions I was getting back, and I even received positive feedback from a few people I sent it too!

![Challenge Assumptions: What assumptions are you making about the effectiveness of badges as motivation for users with social anxiety?  Explore whether intrinsic motivation could be more influential than extrinsic rewards.  Are you assuming that all users will respond positively to a gamified approach, or could some find it counterproductive?  Investigate potential user feedback to validate or invalidate this assumption.](/things-content/thinking-frameworks-and-AI/images/challenge-assumptions.jpg)

![White Hat: What existing data do you have about the prevalence of social anxiety and its impact on daily life?  How can you gather more statistics or research to support your app's effectiveness?  What features do similar apps currently offer, and how do they measure user success?  Can you benchmark these features against your proposed app functionalities?](/things-content/thinking-frameworks-and-AI/images/white-hat.jpg)

So far, I've especially valued the questioning of assumptions which I might not have immediately thought of even with the frameworks in front of me!

### "You could just use ChatGPT/LLM!"

Sure! and I've made a few experiments involving direct ideation with AI, including multi-agent setups which each answer for specific parts of thinking frameworks, however I often enjoy a more manual process, and I think this combination of a basic UI with integrated AI for generating questions, is a nice balance!

## How does it work?

It's almost as simple as it looks! The prompt is sent to the model augmented with the idea typed in and selected framework, and we get structured questions back which get placed into the UI and also cached in local storage in the browser â€” so once questions are generated, switching between frameworks is fast, and we don't ask the AI for the same thing twice!

## Is the AI costing you?

A small amount, but nothing to worry about (for now ðŸ˜†)

## Feedback

I'd love any feedback! Please [email me](mailto:hey@jonothan.dev)!
