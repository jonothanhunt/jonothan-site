I still don't know quite why I make them. Perhaps it's rebellion against presentations, or perhaps just because it's possible.

The good/bad news is that you can make one too using this nifty tutorial:

Did you know you could straight up put 3D models into PowerPoint and then animate them?

(Un)surprisingly, these videos have never taken off...

...perhaps because the songs themselves are of little substance, for example involving the landing position of a hat-stand:

...and other astute observations such as the incompatability between coat hangers and sand-castles:

Regardless, this has been a cathartic pursuit for me, and if it encourages just one person to make their presentation 1% more interesting, I'll consider this a win.
