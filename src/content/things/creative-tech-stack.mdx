I made [Creative Tech Stack](https://www.creativetechstack.dev), a [newsletter/blog](https://www.creativetechstack.dev/) and [tools database](https://www.creativetechstack.dev/tools) for creative technologists & coders.

It's all open source and anyone can add posts and tools on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonothanhunt/creative-tech-stack).
