Progressive blur is all the rage.

But I'm not a fan of how I usually see it implemented on the web.

Have a scroll in this example:

<SandpackEmbed
  basePath="/things-content/progressive-blur-with-css/code/progressive-blur-comparison/"
  files={[{file: "index.html"}, {file: "styles.css", visible: false}]}
  template="static"
  view="preview"
/>


See the lovely *progressive* blur on the left?

Why does it look better?

Because it actually progressively blurs the background, increasing the blur effect the higher it goes. The version on the right is just a blanket backdrop blur with a gradient mask.


Here's how I made progressive blur with CSS:

**Attempt 1:** I thought, why not just stack lots of divs with increasing amounts of backdrop blur?

<SandpackEmbed
  basePath="/things-content/progressive-blur-with-css/code/progressive-blur-simple/"
  files={[{file: "index.html"}, {file: "styles.css", visible: false}]}
  template="static"
/>


It looks cool, but the clear difference between the blur levels isn't the smooth progressive blur we're after.


**Attempt 2:** Overlap them and give each one a gradient mask:

<SandpackEmbed
  basePath="/things-content/progressive-blur-with-css/code/progressive-blur-demo/"
  files={[{file: "index.html"}, {file: "styles.css", visible: false}]}
  template="static"
/>

That was easy!

This isn't *hugely* performant (though you can optimize by using fewer, but larger, blur steps).


I did try some SVG filter effects, but those don't tend to work so well on mobile.


For now though, this worksâ€”and it looks pretty cool!
