Node-based programming was my entry into coding, and I still prefer nodes for creative workflows, like TouchDesigner, TikTok's Effect House, Unity's Shadergraph being some of my favourites.

I've been meaning to make my own node-based *thing* and ALSO try my hand at (Web Assembly (WASM))[https://webassembly.org/]. As a musician, what better way to combine both goals than by making an audio app with a node-based interface and Rust for the audio processing!

Fortunately for me, there exists a wonderful library called [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) made by the [xyflow team](https://xyflow.com/about), which gives you the basics like draggable nodes, wires and a canvas.

From there, with some help from AI, I made an audio engine, and the architecture for making new nodes.

The modular nature of nodes in this project means I can learn Rust & WASM techniques in small chunks as I attempt to get my head around them.

If you're interested in the technical side of things, check out the [project README](https://github.com/jonothanhunt/audio-nodes#readme).

*I love styling my projects, and little touches like blending the wire colours between nodes have been so fun to make!*

I plan to keep adding nodes (there's a todo list in the [project README](https://github.com/jonothanhunt/audio-nodes#readme)) as I learn Rust and WASM!
