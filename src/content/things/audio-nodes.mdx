Node-based programming was my entry into coding, and I still prefer nodes for creative workflows, like in TouchDesigner, TikTok's Effect House, Unity's Shadergraph being some of my favourites.

// IMAGES of NODES IN THOSE SOFTWARES

I've been meaning to make my own node-based *thing* and ALSO try my hand at Web Assembly (WASM). As a musician, what better way to combine both goals than by making an audio app with a node-based interface and Rust for the audio processing!

Fortunately for me, there exists a wonderful library by the XXXX team [React Flow](XXXX), which gives you the basics like connecting wires, draggable nodes and a canvas.

From there, with some help from AI, I made an audio engine, and the architecture for making new nodes.

The modular nature of this task means I can learn to Rust & WASM techniques in small chunks as I attempt to get my head around them.

I *really* enjoy styling in my projects, and little touches like the blended colours of wires between nodes were so much fun to make!

I plan to
