## First of all...

I don't have wisdom as a 26-year-old.

If you want raw, brilliant creative development genius, I recommend checking out the likes of [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/), creator of beautiful 3D web experiences and the most incredible course in React Three Fiber: [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/), as well as [Jen Simmons](https://jensimmons.com/), a pioneer in web standards and layout design, instrumental in shaping CSS Grid and intrinsic web design. You might also explore [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/), [Yugo Nakamura](https://tha.jp/), [Porpentine Charity Heartscape](https://www.fact.co.uk/artist/porpentine-charity-heartscape-2), and [Neal Agarwal](https://neal.fun/).

In my sphere specifically, I look up to [Perry Nightingale](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2HuWX0RpIkIalqZEunbC7a?si=iE82Gu3hQXyNrtNtx_0ocw&nd=1&dlsi=11bbe180617c478b) who leads Creative & AI at WPP, and [Luke Hurd](https://www.threads.com/@lukehurd/media) who is my far-improved counterpart in the US.

## What is a Creative Technologist?

I've met Creative Technologists in manufacturing, design, media and other industries — and we're all bridging a gap between creative vision, and development.

Where I work in advertising [at VML](https://www.vml.com/), my team and I work together with creative, development, experience, design, data-science and other teams to ideate, prototype, develop and experiment.

## What do we make?

Depends where you're working — recently we've developed WebAR experiences, worked on a mentorship app, and the software for an installations in London Waterloo station and Heathrow airport, run workshops, and a bunch of other stuff!

We have full native app and web teams in our business, so we tend to work on projects that require multiple and emerging technologies.

## What do I need to become a Creative Technologist?

If you have a technical intuition relevant to the industry you're entering and love building things, becoming a Creative Technologists mostly involves deciding you are one.

Beyond A-levels (nobody ever asked me about them) and online courses, I haven't any formal qualifications, and I'm doing alright!

To better understand the industry, I took out a loan and attended the [School of Communication Arts 2.0](https://www.schoolcommunicationarts.com/) in Brixton, which also gave me some great ideation techniques.

I thought there was an opportunity for more exciting technical build capabilities directly in creative departments of the agencies I was visiting, so I came up with ideas specifically for them and then emailed their senior creatives and developers for feedback.

Once I had ideas that were consistently liked by the agencies I was visiting, I designed a VR experience where a 'deepfake' version of me presented them.

Senior creatives thought this was exactly the sort of thing their clients wanted, so I got my job.

## Technical skills

What you learn technically will vary depending on where you work, and to what extent you code vs. working with developers — in my role I use the following:

### Extended Reality
* Social AR
  * [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/) — Create interactive AR filters for TikTok
  * [Lens Studio](https://ar.snap.com/) — Build AR lenses for Snapchat
  * [Spark AR](https://spark.meta.com/) (Instagram, Facebook — now out of support!) — Design AR experiences for Meta platforms
* Web AR
  * [8th Wall](https://www.8thwall.com/) — Platform for browser-based AR experiences
  * [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) — Web standard for AR/VR in browsers
* Virtual Reality
  * [Unity](https://unity.com/) — Popular engine for VR app development
  * [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/) — High-fidelity engine for immersive VR

### Web
We build so many things using web apps — from games to screens in physical installations like this one for HSBC:

This is because:

1. the huge range of APIs and features e.g. WebGL for 3D graphics, WebXR for AR/VR, WebRTC for real-time communication, and WebAudio for interactive sound.

2. is supported on basically anything with a browser whether that's a Raspberry Pi, or a super powerful PC

3. natively supports network-based stuff and updates!

4. An amazing culture of open source and loads of amazing libraries and communities e.g. Three.js / React Three Fiber, p5.js and others!

We build most of our projects using Next.js (in TypeScript) as we've found it the fastest to iterate our projects across front and backend, and the excellent Developer Experience like inclusion of Tailwind for styling, make collaboration that much easier and fun! Oh and because everything is so nicely combined together with Next, vibe coding is a real jam.

We use the following most often:

* [React](https://react.dev/) — UI library for building interfaces
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — React framework for SSR & routing
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) — fast dev server & build tool, great for offline PWAs
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — utility-first CSS framework
* [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/) — animation library for React
* [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) — robust animation toolkit, now free
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) / [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) — 3D graphics in the browser
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) — creative coding and interactive graphics
* [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) — friendly machine learning for the web
* [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) — train ML models without code
* [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) — ML framework for JavaScript

### Design & 3D
* 2D design
  * [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/) — vector graphics alternative
  * [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/) — photo editing alternative

* 3D design
  * [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) — open-source 3D modeling & animation
  * [Spline](https://spline.design/) — browser-based 3D design tool
  * [Substance](https://substance3d.adobe.com/) — advanced texturing & materials
  * [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) — 3D scenes in React/web

### Physical tech
* 3D printing
  * [Bambu Lab A1](https://bambulab.com/en/a1) — fast, reliable desktop 3D printer
* Physical builds
  * [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) — compact, flexible computing
* 3D camera: 
  * [Azure Kinect](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/kinect-dk/) — depth-sensing & motion capture
  * [Leap Motion](https://www.ultraleap.com/) — hand tracking & gesture control
